# Sparse Matrix Reordering Method Selection with Parallel Computing and Deep Learning
I am the first author of this article. You are welcome to communicate with me on any of the views in this article. My email address is xiarui21@nudt.edu.cn.

This repository includes the code, data sets, manuscripts used in the experiment. More data is being improved and sorted. If you need, you can also send an email to the above email address for communication.

Due to file size and regional restrictions, we will provide the following resource download addresses on Baidu Netdisk. Since the code is not carefully organized, you may not be able to run it directly. If you want to quickly obtain a runnable version, you can contact me through the above email address for help.

Note: The dataset used in Section B: Performance Loss Experiment in Part V: Evaluation of the paper is the same as the third dataset in the 5-fold dataset.

Correction:
1. The confusion matrix of Fig8 is based on the label shown in the sub-figure title, and the sub-figure title is incorrect.
2. The confusion matrices of Table I and Fig 8 correspond to each other and are from the same experimental data, but Table II is not from the same experimental data as Table I and Fig 8.
